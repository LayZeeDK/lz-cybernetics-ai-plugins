/claude-mem:make-plan Restructure the "Implications for Plugin Development" section in
  research/ralph-loop/CYBERNETICS-ANALYSIS.md from sequential numbering (### 1 through ### 15) into groups by cybernetic          
  tradition. The document currently has 15 enhancement subsections numbered sequentially. Reorganize them into 4 tradition-based 
  groups with sub-subsections, preserving all content:
  
  **Target structure:**
  
  ### First-Order Enhancements
  #### Feedback and Backpressure (current #1, #3)
  #### Variety Management (current #2)
  #### Ultrastable Iteration (current #8)
  #### Good Regulator Maintenance (current #9)
  #### Channel Capacity Monitor (current #10)

  ### Second-Order Enhancements
  #### Autopoietic Learning (current #4)
  #### Black Box Verification (current #6)
  #### Ethical Variety Monitor (current #7)
  #### Structural Context Engineering (current #15)

  ### Management Cybernetics Enhancements
  #### VSM Dashboard (current #5)
  #### Algedonic Channel (current #11)
  #### Redundancy Audit (current #12)

  ### Ecological Cybernetics Enhancements
  #### Learning Level Tracker (current #13)
  #### Double Bind Detector (current #14)

  This restructuring must also:
  1. Update the concept-to-enhancement mapping table (if present) to use new heading references instead of #N numbers
  2. Update all "Maps to:" back-references in enhancement subsections to use section links
  3. Update Key Insights (#1-19) if they reference enhancement numbers
  4. Update any cross-references in PLUGIN-GUIDE.md that reference enhancement numbers
  5. Add a brief introductory paragraph to each tradition group explaining the shared cybernetic lineage
  6. Verify all internal markdown links still resolve after restructuring
