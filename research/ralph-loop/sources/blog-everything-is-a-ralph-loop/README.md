## Summary

A philosophical manifesto arguing that Ralph is not just a coding technique but a fundamental paradigm shift in software development. Huntley describes moving from building software "vertically brick by brick -- like Jenga" to approaching everything as a loop. He positions Ralph as an orchestrator pattern where you allocate specifications, define a goal, and loop until done.

The post introduces "The Weaving Loom" (Loom), Huntley's infrastructure for evolutionary software that aims for autonomous product evolution and revenue optimization -- what he calls "level 9" on Steve Yegge's Gas Town scale. He claims software can now be developed "cheaper than the wage of a burger flipper" and advocates for engineers to learn to "program the new computer" (LLMs).

## Key Concepts

- Ralph is a mindset, not just a technique -- it applies to forward mode (building), reverse mode (clean rooming), and general orchestration
- Software development has shifted from vertical "Jenga" building to loop-based iteration
- Ralph is monolithic: a single process performing one task per loop, avoiding the complexity of multi-agent architectures
- "Watch the loop" -- personal development comes from observing failure domains and engineering solutions
- HITL operation (manual prompting or Ctrl+C pauses) is still "ralphing" as long as you apply context engineering
- The Weaving Loom ("Loom") is infrastructure for evolutionary software -- autonomous optimization and self-healing
- First observed instance of "evolutionary software auto heal" -- a ralph loop identified a bug, fixed it, deployed it, and verified the fix automatically
