## Summary

Announcement of Cursed, a Gen-Z themed programming language created entirely by running Claude in a loop (Ralph) for three months. The language replaces standard lexical keywords with Gen Z slang terminology (e.g., `slay` for `func`, `yeet` for `import`, `periodt` for `while`). It demonstrates that Ralph can create complex systems including compilers with LLVM backends.

## Key Concepts

- Cursed is a Golang-like language with Gen Z slang keywords
- Compiler has dual modes: interpreted and compiled execution
- LLVM backend producing binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Editor extensions for VSCode, Emacs, and Vim
- Treesitter grammar support
- The author positions this as a possible "seventh stage" of developer AI adoption
- Success criteria: appearing in the Stack Overflow developer survey
- Key quote from David Fowler: "If you're using AI only to 'do' and not 'learn', you are missing out"

### Lexical Keyword Samples

| Cursed | Go equivalent |
|--------|--------------|
| `vibe` | `package` |
| `yeet` | `import` |
| `slay` | `func` |
| `sus` | `var` |
| `damn` | `return` |
| `ready` | `if` |
| `otherwise` | `else` |
| `bestie` | `for` |
| `periodt` | `while` |
| `based` | `true` |
| `cringe` | `false` |
| `nah` | `nil` |
