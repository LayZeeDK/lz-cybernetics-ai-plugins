## Summary

A deep-dive comparison between two implementations of the Ralph technique: the original bash loop approach and the Anthropic official plugin. Both implementations are tested against the "kustomark" project as a common benchmark, examining trade-offs between simplicity and features.

## Key Topics

- Bash-loop vs plugin-based Ralph implementations
- Human-on-the-loop philosophy
- Context engineering strategies
- Kustomark as test case
- When simplicity beats sophistication
- Criticism of Anthropic plugin's opacity compared to original loop's transparency
