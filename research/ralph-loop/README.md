# Ralph Loop Research

A knowledge base documenting the Ralph Wiggum Loop technique for autonomous AI coding agents.

## Contents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md) | Core concepts, philosophy, and the basic pattern |
| [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) | Technical implementation details and code examples |
| [FAILURE-MODES.md](./FAILURE-MODES.md) | Known failure patterns and mitigations |
| [BEST-PRACTICES.md](./BEST-PRACTICES.md) | Tips, guardrails, and practical guidance |
| [HISTORY.md](./HISTORY.md) | Timeline and evolution of the technique |
| [CYBERNETICS-ANALYSIS.md](./CYBERNETICS-ANALYSIS.md) | Analysis through a Cybernetics lens |
| [sources/](./sources/) | Primary source materials (blogs, videos, transcripts) |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# The Ralph Loop in its purest form
while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done
```

**Key Insight:** Progress persists in files and git history, not in the LLM's context window.
